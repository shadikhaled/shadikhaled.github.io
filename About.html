              I am Shadi Abdulla Khaled. I was born in Qamishli, located in the north-east of Syria and now I am living in Iraq since 2013. I studied at a music institute. I also was a manager at a Hotel for many years, where I managed employees and was responsible for the planning, marketing, coordinating and administering hotel services such as catering and accommodation facilities. I have computer training, ICDL certificate, and knowledge about many computer applications like Word, Excel, Access, Powerpoint. I worked as music teacher for primary school students, where I created lesson plans, provided instruction in music performance, and theory-from fundamentals to more advanced music theory. My hobbies are writing poetry and reading world novels.

              <p class="paper">
                After I learned about the Re:coded course of study, I was very excited because it would give me knowledge, skills and experience in programing, as well as in improving my English language, because coding depends on this language. I also had the opportunity to study and recieve a certificate in Project Management.

                There is no doubt that this will open the door for opportunities in front of me to work with major international companies, and NGOs. It will also prepare me to work as a web developer and designer.

                When I finish the course I will have obtained several certifications through Re:Coded. I will try to find job and work in programming, and I will design new sites and revise old sites to continue my practice.
